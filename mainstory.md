The door swings open and crashes into the wall, deepening the dent that had been forming for the past two years. He steps out of the old building and looks out to the small alley. The dim glow of the setting sun lighting up the sky in shades of blue and pink. The power lines stretch across this peaceful area, bringing the hum of life to a once small community. I’ve heard some interesting thoughts from people of the village about how this technology would “bring the end of the world”, but that just seems full of despair. 

He steps out of the house, down the front steps and out onto the gravel path. The rocks scattering forwards and away from his feet as he walks down the alley. He has a messenger bag slung over his shoulders, the thin strap digging into his clavicle, a bone that hadn't seen much trouble, however, the rest of his body had seen better days. In his years at high school, he got into constant fights with his classmates, and they weren’t gentle either, mind you, they were full-on brawls often ending with some sort of suspension, and one or more broken bones.

If you were to see him the first thing you would notice would be his eyes. They were a brilliant blue-green mixture, and if you looked into them for long enough you could hear them speak. They could talk for hours, but you wouldn't want to hear what they had to say. They would find the qualities that hated the most about yourself and taunt you with them. The more you looked into them, the more they could see about you. The pupils of those eyes were deeper than a canyon, they pulled in so much light that even your vision starts to bend towards them. These eyes had seen a lot but they were going to see much more soon.

As he reaches the end of the alley he turns to the right, now walking on a propper road. one side of the sidewalk is covered in pink and blue hydrangeas that have wrapped themselves around a fence. the Hydrangeas stretch down the side of the road for miles, only stopping when the road goes through a mountain underpass. On the other side, there is a road, it isn't very busy, but the deep indentations from the tires of many year's worths of a lively industry tell a different story. with each passing car, the grooves add another tally-mark to their list, an ever-expanding never-ending list. he stops walking and begins to climb the fence, his muscles moving in quick and well-practiced movements. as he reaches the top he stops and looks out to the landscape around him. hee looks out and sees a once-thriving city on one side, and a dense forest on the other. *What a brilliant contrast* He thinks to himself. He jumps off of the fence and moves swiftly down the incline just beyond the fence. walking beside the water until he reaches a small patch of grass that had been pushed down. He sits down and crosses his legs and closes his eyes.

As he sits there all of the problems that he has been worrying about drift away, and the only things he focuses on are the sounds of the birds singing as they fly through the air, and the gentle rustle of the trees, and the thunderous roar of the river. He had started when he first moved out here, as a way to try and control his anger problems, but it has since become much more than just a way to control it, has become a safe haven for whenever he feels too overwhelmed. 

In his heightened state of awareness, he could hear the sound of someone’s shoes walking across the sand. the footsteps were heavy, meaning it was likely a man, and there was only one person who matched that description who was going to be nearby that night, and that was Kyle.

"Hiya Roch," Kyle said loudly  
Roch's eyes shot open "Kyle!" he exclaimed "so good to see you decide to join me tonight"  
"well it was either this or spend another night stuck in my home, and I’ve had enough of that lately"  
"say less, my man!"  

Kyle extended his hand down to Roch and pulled him off of his patch of grass with very little effort. Kyle was not only strong but built like a Dorito, with broad shoulders tapering down into a moderately sized waist. The thing that would set him appart from all of the other dude-bros though is his smile, it knew how to cheer you up on a sad day, and it knew how to make you day go from good to great.

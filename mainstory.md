The door swings open and crashes into the wall, deepening the dent that had been forming for the past two years. He steps out of the old building and looks out to the small alley. The dim glow of the setting sun lighting up the sky in shades of blue and pink. The power lines stretch across this peaceful area, bringing the hum of life to a once small community. I’ve heard some interesting thoughts from people of the village about how this technology would “bring the end of the world”, but that just seems full of despair. 

He steps out of the house, down the front steps and out onto the gravel path. The rocks scattering forwards and away from his feet as he walks down the alley. He has a messenger bag slung over his shoulders, the thin strap digging into his clavicle, a bone that hadn't seen much trouble, however, the rest of his body had seen better days. In his years at high school, he got into constant fights with his classmates, and they weren’t gentle either, mind you, they were full-on brawls often ending with some sort of suspension, and one or more broken bones.

If you were to see him the first thing you would notice would be his eyes. They were a brilliant blue-green mixture, and if you looked into them for long enough you could hear them speak. They could talk for hours, but you wouldn't want to hear what they had to say. They would find the qualities that hated the most about yourself and taunt you with them. The more you looked into them, the more they could see about you. The pupils of those eyes were deeper than a canyon, they pulled in so much light that even your vision starts to bend towards them. These eyes had seen a lot but they were going to see much more soon.

As he reaches the end of the alley he turns to the right, now walking on a proper road. one side of the sidewalk is covered in pink and blue hydrangeas that have wrapped themselves around a fence. the Hydrangeas stretch down the side of the road for miles, only stopping when the road goes through a mountain underpass. On the other side, there is a road, it isn't very busy, but the deep indentations from the tires of many year's worth of a lively industry tell a different story. With each passing car, the grooves add another tally-mark to their list, an ever-expanding never-ending list. he stops walking and begins to climb the fence, his muscles moving in quick and well-practiced movements. as he reaches the top he stops and looks out to the landscape around him. he looks out and sees a once-thriving city on one side, and a dense forest on the other. *What a brilliant contrast* He thinks to himself. He jumps off of the fence and moves swiftly down the incline just beyond the fence. walking beside the water until he reaches a small patch of grass that had been pushed down. He sits down and crosses his legs and closes his eyes.

As he sits there all of the problems that he has been worrying about drift away, and the only things he focuses on are the sounds of the birds singing as they fly through the air, and the gentle rustle of the trees, and the thunderous roar of the river. He had started when he first moved out here, as a way to try and control his anger problems, but it has since become much more than just a way to control it, has become a safe haven for whenever he feels too overwhelmed. 

In his heightened state of awareness, he could hear the sound of someone’s shoes walking across the sand. the footsteps were heavy, meaning it was likely a man, and there was only one person who matched that description who was going to be nearby that night, and that was Kyle.

"Hiya Roch," Kyle said loudly  
Roch's eyes shot open "Kyle!" he exclaimed "so good to see you decide to join me tonight"  
"well it was either this or spend another night stuck in my home, and I’ve had enough of that lately"  
"say less, my man!"  

Kyle extended his hand down to Roch and pulled him off of his patch of grass with very little effort. Kyle was not only strong but built like a Dorito, with broad shoulders tapering down into a moderately sized waist. The thing that would set him apart from all of the other dude-bros though is his smile, it knew how to cheer you up on a sad day, and it knew how to make your day go from good to great. Aside from his other hobbies of working out and working out, Kyle loved to read and write poetry, it was his favourite thing to do in the world. Like someone addicted to caffeine, he would begin his morning by reading one piece of poetry, the creating one of his own. They were never really that good, but Kyle wasn’t exactly the sharpest tool in the shed.

The two walk side-by-side, step-in-step, back up over the fence, and down onto the sidewalk, and back into the town. however, on their journey, something was amiss, for whatever reason Roch was checking behind him every few minutes and making turns seemingly at random. however, they finally reached their destination. it was a small apartment, it was painted a dull grey that, in the fading light looked almost red. on each of the three floors there was a small window, and beneath each window, and on either side of the door was an Ofuda each with a name of a different ***Kami*** inscribed.

Kyle looked at Roch   
"I don’t know if I like the look of this, Roch."  
"Just follow me, it will all be ok".  

Roch walks up to the polished wooden door and knocks, very forcefully, three times, then steps back. A few seconds pass and the door opens about halfway and a man pokes his head out and asks to talk to Roch, the two exchange a few words, then the man walks inside, and gestures for Roch and Kyle to follow him. The inside of the apartment was almost pitch black, with the only light coming from a few candles dispersed about the room. There were several other people in the room but there was so little light that it was impossible to make out any defining features on any of them. Roch walks to the centre of the room where a circular mirror is placed, he slings the messenger bag off of his shoulder and onto the ground. He then unbuckled the top and started to take things out of the bag. Before long he had pulled nearly 20 candles from this bag. These candles along with the other 80 that had been brought by the others made up the basis of the game. one of the shadowy figures steps forward towards the candles that have been arranged in a circle around the mirror. They light a match and reach down to the first candle, then they light the next, and again, until all of them have been lit.

the two of them stand and turn to go. As Roch reaches the door, he turns around and says to the cluster of people "I hope we can do this again sometime, maybe something interesting will happen then". He shakes his head as the two of them walk out the door. The outside world was bathed in an orange twilight that lit up the tops of the buildings in an eerie glow. On their way back home Kyle attempted to make conversation.

"So that was lame huh?"  
"yeah, it sure was" Roch responded dully "maybe next time you come by something more fun will happen".

They had arrived at the fence, it was strange seeing two figures cloaked in shadow climbing a fence, it looked very out of place. as they reached the bottom of hill on the other side of the fence. They looked at each other, then walked away from each other. Kyle walked to the east, towards the rising sun, and his home, and Roch turned to the left, and walked beside the river for a while.

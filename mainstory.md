The door swings open and crashes into the wall, deepening the dent that had been forming for the past two years. He steps out of the old building and looks out to the small alley. The dim glow of the setting sun lighting up the sky in shades of blue and pink. The power lines stretch across this peaceful area, bringing the hum of life to a once small community. I’ve heard some interesting thoughts from people of the village about how this technology would “bring the end of the world”, but that just seems full of despair. 

He steps out of the house, down the front steps and out onto the gravel path. The rocks  scattering forwards and away from his feet as he walks down the alley. He has a messenger bag slung over his shoulders, the thin strap digging into his clavicle, a bone that hadn't seen much trouble, however the rest of his body had seen better days. In his years at highschool he got into constant fights with his classmates, they were rough ones too, mind you, they were full on brawls often ending with some sort of suspension, and one or more broken bones.

If you were to see him the first thing you would notice would be his eyes. They were a brilliant blue green mixture, and if you looked into them for long enough you could hear them speak. They could talk for hours, but you wouldn't want to hear what they had to say. They would find the qualities that hated the most about yourself, and taunt you with them. The more you looked into them, the more they could see about you. The pupils of those eyes were deeper than a canyon, they pulled in so much light that even your vision starts to bend towards them. These eyes had seen a lot but they were going to see much more soon.

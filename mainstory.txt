The door swings open and crashes into the wall. I look out, the dim light bouncing off the walls of the building around me that rise out of the ground like a poorly healed scar. The setting sun lights the the sky with a hazy red glow. The power poles over my head stretch to my left and right, i've heard people call them the tendons of the world, connecting us all to one network. I say that that means nothing, tendons or not, they are remnants of life, and i came out here to be free.

I walk down the road, i kick at the rocks and pebbles as i walk

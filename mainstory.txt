As Rock steps into the streed, the sun burns into his eyes. he lifts his hand to cover his eyes, and the sun bounces off his pale skin back at me. 
Ive seen him come and go from this building numnerous times. almost every night he makes the trip from his house to this apartment.
Its strange, i dont know why i feel the pull to this apartment.
I have left my usual resting place of the forrest to make the journey out here

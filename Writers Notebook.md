## Process:
I started my research with a collection of Japanese creates portrayed in a book by a man by the name of Toriyama Seiken. 
This collection of yokai was a good starting place for my research as it spanned everything from bells to creatures with eyes on their hands. 
But I took particular interest in a creature called the Aoandon this yokai would appear at the end of a game called Hyakumonogatari Kaidankai, but didn't really do anything. 
I then decided to look more into this game, and it turned out to be really interesting. So now I needed to find what kind of creature my main character was going to face. 
After finding a website with some interesting stories, I finally decided on the Hidarugami (hunger god(s)). 

## Story outline:

1. Char plays Hyakumonogatari Kaidankai
2. Nothing happens after 100th lantern
3. Except
4. Char living life, goes for walk
5. Finds Hidarugami
6. Either starves to death or makes it back to safety

This book was the only credible source that i could find that actually had anecdotes about Yokai. many of the stories shared in the hyakumonogatari kaidenkai scene were inspired by the stories in this book.

What is Hyakumonogatari?., 2010. Web. May 14, 2021
This website has a great wealth of information on this ritual and Japanese spirits as a whole. I used this website as a sort of spring board for my research. It not only gave me a concise definition as to why this ritual actually is/was but the list of creatures available on the site was invaluable.

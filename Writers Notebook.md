## Process:
I started my research with a collection of Japanese creates portrayed in a book by a man by the name of Toriyama Seiken. 
This collection of yokai was a good starting place for my research as it spanned everything from bells to creatures with eyes on their hands. 
But I took particular interest in a creature called the Aoandon this yokai would appear at the end of a game called Hyakumonogatari Kaidankai, but didn't really do anything. 
I then decided to look more into this game, and it turned out to be really interesting. So now I needed to find what kind of creature my main character was going to face. 
After finding a website with some interesting stories, I finally decided on the Hidarugami (hunger god(s)). 

## Story outline:

1. Char plays Hyakumonogatari Kaidankai
2. Nothing happens after 100th lantern
3. Except
4. Char living life, goes for walk
5. Finds Hidarugami
6. Either starves to death or makes it back to safety
